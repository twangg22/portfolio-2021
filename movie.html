            Vincent died a mysterious death…
            One night on a road, a man was walking… he was carrying nothing; his hands clasped to a fresh bullet wound
            leaking blood from his belly. This was Vincent van Gogh, then a little-known artist; now the most famous
            artist in the world. His tragic death has long been known, what has remained a mystery is how and why he
            came to be shot.
        </p>
        <p>
            Loving Vincent is the world’s first fully painted film. As it is painted over 65,000 frames on over 1,000
            canvases, Loving Vincent tells that story.

                        Vincent and read about his close relationship with his brother Theo. What I found amazing about
                        this movie was the imaginative approach that was taken to unravel his life and work. So many
                        details were revealed that I had no idea of, and put into such interesting context. The choice
                        of actors was brilliant and we see how close they resemble the actual people during the credit
                        roll at the end of the film - also highly imaginative. I love the rich colours, the Cerulean
                        blue and bright yellows. Truly a starry night! Don't miss."</p>

                        "This is an astonishing feat. When animated shorts are nominated for Academy Awards, they
                        frequently run 10 to 15 minutes. How a group of artists were able to "paint" the scenes and
                        incorporate great paintings into a really fine story of full movie length is beyond my
                        comprehension. Van Gogh is dead and so is his brother, Theo. It is thought that he took his own
                        life for whatever reason. Lord knows he had enough issues, including his utter genius. A family
                        friend is dispatched to deliver a last letter from the great artist to his brother, but when the
                        friend arrives, he find Theo is dead. This guy has his own issues and at first tires of his
                        task, but when he finds that there is some suspicious stuff relating to the "suicide," he
                        becomes entrenched in solving the case. A running theme is that Van Gogh had no weight because
                        of his lack of commercial success and, beside that, he was weird. As the friend gets into the
                        case, we get to know that there were people who cared about him and liked him, but they also
                        didn't do much to hold him up. As others have said, this is an amazing expression of the
                        painter''s world, put before us through his paintings. One other thing. Don't leave the theater
                        too soon because there are some great closing items that one shouldn't miss."

            Movie Summary
        </h2>
        <p>
            A year after the death of artist Vincent van Gogh (Robert Gulaczyk), Postman Joseph Roulin Chris O'Dowd)
            gets his slacker son, Armand (Douglas Booth), to hand deliver the artist's final letter written to his now
            late brother, Theo (Cezary Lukaszewicz), to some worthy recipient after multiple failed postal delivery
            attempts. Although disdainful of this seemingly pointless chore, Armand travels to Auvers-sur-Oise where a
            purported close companion to Vincent, Dr. Gachet (Jerome Flynn), lives. Having to wait until the doctor
            returns from business, Armand meets many of the people of that village who not only knew Vincent, but were
            apparently also models and inspirations for his art. In doing so, Armand becomes increasingly fascinated in
            the psyche and fate of van Gogh as numerous suspicious details fail to add up. However, as Armand digs
            further, he comes to realize that Vincent's troubled life is as much a matter of interpretation as his
            paintings, and there are no easy answers for a man whose work and tragedy would only be truly appreciated in
            the future.
