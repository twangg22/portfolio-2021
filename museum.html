                <p>The Van Gogh Museum is a Dutch art museum dedicated to the works of Vincent van Gogh and his
                    contemporaries in the Museum Square in Amsterdam South, close to the Stedelijk Museum, the
                    Rijksmuseum, and the Concertgebouw. The museum opened on 2 June 1973, and its buildings were
                    designed by Gerrit Rietveld and Kisho Kurokawa.

                    The museum contains the largest collection of Van Gogh's paintings and drawings in the world. In
                    2017, the museum had 2.3 million visitors and was the most-visited museum in the Netherlands, and
                    the 23rd-most-visited art museum in the world. In 2019, the Van Gogh Museum launched the Meet
                    Vincent Van Gogh Experience, a technology-driven "immersive exhibition" on Van Gogh's life and
                    works, which has toured globally (Source: Wikipedia).</p>

                    Vincent van Gogh’s work is in such high demand for exhibitions around the world that it’s rare to
                    find 16 of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s paintings by the Dutch master at home together in New
                    York at one time. But now, for the first time in four years, the Met’s full set of Van Gogh canvases
                    from the department of European paintings are on view at the museum in galleries 822 and 825
                    (Source: artnet).

                <p> As one of the most recognized painting in Western Art, Vincent van Gogh's The Starry Night has been
                    a visitor favorite at MoMA since it first appeared in our Van Gogh retrospective in 1935 and then
                    was acquired in 1941. To become acquainted with the heart and mind of its maker, there is no better
                    source than his letters (Source: MOMA).

                <p> The Kröller-Müller Museum is Vincent van Gogh’s second home. With almost 90 paintings and over 180
                    drawings, the museum has the second-largest Van Gogh collection in the world.
                    Since the opening of the Kröller-Müller Museum in 1938, the works of Vincent Van Gogh have hung in
                    the heart of the building: a corridor around a small patio, now called the Van Gogh gallery.
                    The work of Vincent van Gogh occupies a special place in the collection of Anton and Helene
                    Kröller-Müller, the founders of the Kröller-Müller Museum. Thanks to them, the museum has the second
                    largest Van Gogh collection in the world. Between 1908 and 1929, they purchase no fewer than 91
                    paintings and more than 180 works on paper. Their budget is virtually unlimited. Helene considers
                    Van Gogh to be 'one of the great spirits of modern art'(Source: Kröller-Müller Museum).
